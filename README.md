# Book-Recommendation-System


Hello Everyone, This is my <strong>Book Recommendation Project</strong> where I have implemented both collaborative and content based recommendation system. I have developed this project on only limited dataset. If we increase the dataset, the outcome will be far more better. Similarly, this application has all the basic web application feature such as Registration, Login, User Authentication, Contact page with email sending to concern person, About page. All the pages of this application is dynamic. 

Concern branch contain two folder: 
   <ul>
  <li>
    myrecommendationsystem
  </li>
   <li>
    src
  </li>
  </ul>
   
  => <strong>myrecommendationsystem</strong> is the web application part where the recommendation system frontend part is developed using the django framework, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap4. <br><br>
  => <strong>src</strong> is the API part of the recommendation system. API is developed using the Flask framework. It include both the API part of Collaborative and Content base recommendation system. 
  
  
 <strong>myrecommendationsystem</strong> in this folder there is the requirements.txt file which include all the required library name to run the web application. To run this part you can go ahead with virtual or any other environment. In the setting.py folder you have to update the Email configuration to send the email from the contact us page. Similarly,  <strong>src</strong> in this folder there is also requirements.txt file which include all the required library name to run the API part. To run the file, you have to choose the anaconda environment.
